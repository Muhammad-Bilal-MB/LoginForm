# LoginForm
**Login form** developed in *C#* with database for storing and retrieving data. A user can register on this and then can login too. So basically it's a complete form for sign-up and signing-in. It's a semester project I made in subject *VISUAL PROGRAMMING*.
Database connection is made through ***Microsoft SQL Server***.
